#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/PK1cmt](https://shinyappstore.com/a/PK1cmt)__

PK1cmt is a powerful application designed for simulating one-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and exploring diverse dosing regimens with varying parameters. With PK1cmt, users can easily generate oral PK profiles based on specified doses and model parameters. This tool enables the visualization and customization of PK profiles, making it a valuable asset for researchers, pharmacologists, and healthcare professionals. In the realm of pharmacokinetics, understanding compartmental analysis is crucial. PK1cmt simplifies this process and helps users differentiate between non-compartmental and compartmental PK analysis approaches. It empowers users to derive essential parameters from PK profiles, facilitating data-driven decision-making in drug development and dosing strategies. PK1cmt is your trusted companion for PK profile simulations, offering an intuitive and efficient solution for exploring the world of pharmacokinetics.
